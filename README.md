# JavaScript-Learning

I have known enough to be dangerous in jQuery for many years. Because of this fact, it's really been easy to just list "x years JavaScript experience" on job applications, or in portfolios, resumes, etc. Did I truly know JavaScript? Yes and no, but mostly no.

I'm currently on a "journey" to learn more about JavaScript in depth. I'm currently working through a book series called "You Don't Know JavaScript". The book is available for free on GitHub, and it was written by Kyle Simpson. I have already read through the first book in the series called "Up & Going". Right now I'm reading through the book "Scope & Closures".

I'm taking on the journey to become more intimately knowledgable in JavaScript so I understand how the language works, how I can write great JavaScript code, and how I can contribute better to whatever team/project I'm on. It's my career goal to be able to help organisations make technical decisions on frameworks, libraries or vanilla JS, and for me to be able to assist in giving thoughts on why something should or shouldn't be used.

JavaScript Resources I am working with:

If you have questions, you can also contact me at carl@wuensche.ca or visit my website at http://carlwuensche.com. I am going to be re-writing my website to be focused on current and past experience, as well as continuing to write blog posts teaching about what I'm working on. I do already also have blog posts currently on my website, just one post I recently wrote on JavaScript.
