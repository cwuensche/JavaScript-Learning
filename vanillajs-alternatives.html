<p>I keep finding new amazing ways to accomplish the same jQuery tasks in vanilla JS. Why is this amazing? Because it allows you to accomplish the same things you
were doing in jQuery without having to load all the extra JavaScript files for.</p>
<p>If you want to add on click to an item in jQuery, you would use something like</p>
<pre>$(document).on('click', '.element-with-class', function() {
// your JavaScript here});</pre>
<p>In vanilla JavaScript, you can do the same thing by going like this</p>
<pre>document.addEventListener('click', function( event ) {
// Your JavaScript here
});
var eltest = document.getElementById('id');
eltest.addEventListener('click', function( event ) {
// Your JavaScript here
});
</pre>
